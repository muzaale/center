# GitHub & Stata

**GPT-4:** GitHub is a powerful platform for collaborative software development, enabling researchers to manage, share, and refine codebases with version control and peer review capabilities.

It's owned by Microsoft. No conflicts to declare here, although I do own a very trivial number of shares in it.

Apple, Google, and Meta are outright rivals of Microsoft, but they do use GitHub for their **Open Source** projects.

Because this research pearl is in the spirit of **Open Science**, I wish to emphasize the point that GitHub represents `cross-industry standardization` in all matters "open."

When Meta launched a most powerful LLM called Llama3 a few day ago, which its marketing as an open source AI, it appropriately created a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3) with all necessary data, code, parameters and documentation for the public to review. Any updates to this repo are visible to you. 

With rival tech titans finding this platform useful, the question to the clinical and public health research community is this: are you missing out on something big?

This presentation doesn't address this question, but hopes to offer an `aperitivo` to whet your appetite.
